It is the dummy text file which is added to make this NuGet package to be treated as project level one.
In current NuGet version, there is a problem that it treats all NuGet packages which don't have files in content or lib directories as solution level packages.

This file will be deleted when NuGet will run PowerShell script in the install.ps1 during package install phase.
